# PLI - Samaritan

PLI stands for "Projet Libre Innovant" (Innovative free codecamp).
It's part of our school program.

## Description

We want to analyze video streams for security interest. We want
to detect dangerous behavior like the following :

- Fightings
- Fires
- People crossing the road when the light's red Oo
- Weapons
- People that have weapons but no uniforms

Our ultimate goal would be to detect habits of the people that are
often captured by our CCTV cameras and to track them from one camera to another

## Technologies


### Darknet YOLO, Tensorflow, CAFFE ... - Machine Learning frameworks

We can use Machine Learning frameworks to perform object detection and then process the information.

**Advantage** : It's fast, well done and we don't have to deal with the difficult part (Mathematics, algorithmes ...). It's already optimized.

**Inconvenient** : We can do the project without understanding what the code (the framework) really does. Then we'll just learn how to use a framework and won't understand *deep learning* and *neural networks* as we want to.



### Coding our own algorithmes and neural networks

We can read scientific papers about object detection and tracking and then implements algorithmes that researchers have developped.

**Advantage** : We'll be able to fully understand how object detection and tracking works. We'll learn how to implement algorithmes from scientific papers (that's a huge thing).

**Inconvenient** : It requires a lot of time and theorical knowledge.


### What we do :

We'll realize a POC (Proof Of Concept) with ML frameworks and then take the time to learn more about object detection algorithmes and try to implement them from scratch.
